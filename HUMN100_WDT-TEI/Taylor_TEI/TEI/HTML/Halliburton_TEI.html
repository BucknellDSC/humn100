      <h2>STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H
         BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
         OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock
         P.M.</h2>PRESENT: Mr. W.C. Doran, Deputy District Attorney, Miss
      Mary Miles Minter, John G. Mott,
      attorney for Miss Minter, and G. H.
      Boone, shorthand reporter.<br />---o---<br />STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER<br />Questions by Mr. Doran:<br /><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>She must have been 50. Her son was Mr Taylor's
      camera man. Jimmy was my camera man,
      Jim Vantrees. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me.
      She is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of
      fate it was when I was in France after looking at the
      beautifUl Venus de Muile in Paris at the Louvre, and after
      I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who
      should I see but Julia Crawford Ivers, a very, fat, large
      woman. She did some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very
      unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and Mr
      Taylor, she would always come and twit my chin. So I said, in really
      a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't think she had
      anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who would
      kill him but Ju1ia Crawford Ivers.""I always suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she
      might have killed him for that reason." He said, "My goodness!
      You mustn't say that out loud; somebody will believe you." I said,
      "I don't care if they do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, --
      What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked about his
      productions and said, "I certainly have a
      terrible time, working day and night and a great deal
      depended upon Saturday and we must get certain work finished Friday." We
      talked of Fridaynight and that he had to get up at eight o'clock; he
      wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling
      for him at eight o'clock, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he
      would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
      location, I understood, possibly at the
      studio. He was just going home
      and take a shower, get a shave if he felt like it, and go
      on back and work some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so
      exhausted, just dead." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this
      looks awful, being here all this time?" And he said, "I can't
      help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what
      you knew about this case. That I know you knew Bill very
      well, probably better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me
      to tel1 him my feelings toward Mr Taylor, exactly what
      everybody has been asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved
      him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I loved him truly, loved him in an
      all-around way, I cared for his health; his health came before my happiness and
      when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when he was ill-- my natural
      impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up night after night with him, if
      necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because he didn't want me to,
      and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and worrying about it, I
      did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want me.<br /><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>What time of night did you first meet -- What is this man's
      name?<br /><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Mr Neilan?<br /><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Mr Neilan, this particular night.<br /><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>We went down to the Salt Lake station after
      one.<br /><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>And you arrived at your home, was it, or his
      home or whose home was it where
      you were frying the eggs?<br /><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>His home, Fridaynight; it was really Saturdaymorning, wasn't it? I call lt Fridaynight, because it was still nighttime. The five of us
      arrived there, oh, I don't know, he didn't finish work until between
      two-thirty and three o'c1ock, maybe after three; I
      didn't have a watch at that time.<br /><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>How long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the
      studio?<br /><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Now, let me see, we stayed at Marshall's house
      with the eggs and things at least an hour,
      maybe two hours; I am not certain of that at all; I don't think much
      more than an hour. Then we went right on to the
      studio.<br /><hr />
