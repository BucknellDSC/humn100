      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Ryan Carroll</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Were you engaged to be married?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No, we were not.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> At the <font xmlns="" color="orange">time of his death</font>, it was --<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MR. MOTT:</h4>Right there at that point you might explain about the rising sun, with reference
      to your engagement. I think that explains the attitude between both of you.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> I don't know just which to do, whether to tell you this whole thing, go right
      along and talk. I can easily do that.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MR. MOTT:</h4> He asked if you were engaged to him. Tell him about the "rising sun"
      explanation.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>I can tell you the whole thing better without being asked.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MR. DORAN:</h4> Yes. Go ahead. and tell us in your own way all about it.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> I had always known that this was just an exquisite chapter in my life that must
      necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part with it; it was just a
      beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the <font xmlns="" color="orange">world today</font> as I see it, as it is
      forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met him; I had always been
      a reserved, very retiring young girl, and he was the first man and the only man
      who ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented
      that to me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any
      of my ideals that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first
      formulated he said to me, "Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December,
      and this is not right. I know it is best that we must part." This was at the very
      beginning of it, and I said, "Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold
      thing; I couldn't try to withhold a person's love for me who didn't care for me.""
      I said, "I know that you are many years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody
      as I love you. I simply love you." And we did try to part, We tried it again and
      again, and then he would beoome ill. At one time I had almost resolved to see him
      no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else cared, [page 6] really cared whether
      he ate his dinner or whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of
      himself, and I couldn't bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of
      sweetheart, but I wanted to be his nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was
      aching. I wanted him to tell me his mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let
      me soothe them away for him as I would for a little child. I forgot the man's age;
      it meant nothing to me. The only thing I wanted was to serve him as I would have
      served the Lord or a little child, and then it just passed away; for months at a
      time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why. Finally, I decided there was no
      use; it must come to an end and I went there on the night of the 23d to give him
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">this letter</font> telling him "goodbye." I had reason to believe, in the awful
      vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went there to say "goodbye"
      myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when he opened the door. I
      said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you? You know
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mama</font> has been sick for three months and you have been ill
      and I have been frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call
      me to tell me that you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo
      that things are all right." I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it wouldn't have
      hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not leave me in the
      dark." He said, "Mary I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I can't explain it to you." Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr Doran, that the words
      just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it to you as it really
      is. There is so much more to it.<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Julies Chakos</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">MR DORAN</h4>At that time, on <font xmlns="" color="orange">December 23d</font>, let's see, he was killed on
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">February 1st</font>. Who was directing you then?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Who directed the last one?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>My last director was <font xmlns="" color="blue">Frank Urson</font>.
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> so often, often made the remark to me that he
      wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have
      been married today and he been younger. He explained our not. being engaged in
      that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never would love for
      another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You know,
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>, to me you are the morning
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">sun</font>, bright, beaut1ful, and with the
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">world</font> and a futune before you, and I am the setting
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">sun</font>, and don't you see, my dear, it simply cannot
      be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the impression that I begged him to
      marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that. I never even called him
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">"Billie"</font> in my life. The man was too wonderful for that.
      He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or what they prove against him. I
      knew him as the finest thing in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">world</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MR MOTT</h4>He as the embodyment of your ideal?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Yes, and I can say now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those ugly
      things which have been said about him. I never found him so. He was glorious to
      me.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MR DORAN</h4>I read in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">paper</font> where you had been engaged to some
      other man.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>To <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Dickson</font>. That is not entirely true.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>What is his first name?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4><font xmlns="" color="blue">Thomas Dickson</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Someone besides him, a director in the movies.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4><font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>, engaged to him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Yes, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>. Didn't I read in the
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">papers</font> that you had been engaged to him and the
      engagement had been broken off?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>That is not true. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Dickson</font> is the only one to whom I have
      been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of despondency.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>What about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>? Were you engaged to him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>No.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Had you been going with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font> during, say the last
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">thirty or sixty days prior to <font color="blue">Taylor's</font>
         death?</font><br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Going with him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Had you been out anywhere with him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with him; I am not sure whether it was
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">within the thirty days</font> or not, but in <font xmlns="" color="orange">the last two
         months</font>, yes sir; but going with him no more than I had for
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">years</font> off and on. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan's</font> traits [page 9]
      are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we
      never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay
      with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all
      charmed with his personality, but don't take him seriously.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Has he proposed to you?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Must I answer that? Yes, he did.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Do you recall approximately when it was?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4><font xmlns="" color="orange">About two months ago.</font><br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>That would take it to <font xmlns="" color="orange">December 1st</font>, approximately or <font xmlns="" color="orange">in the
         middle of December</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, <font xmlns="" color="orange">December 1st</font>
      -- I wish I could tell you.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>With reference to this <font xmlns="" color="orange">December 23d</font> that you called on
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>, when was it?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>It as <font xmlns="" color="orange">before the <font color="orange">1st of December</font></font>, I think.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Q. <font xmlns="" color="orange">Before the <font color="orange">1st of December</font></font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Yes; about <font xmlns="" color="orange">the last of November</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I
      didn't take him seriously. I joked with him at the time.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>Did he seem to be serious?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought possibly
      he was joking, or had a few <font xmlns="" color="purple">cocktails</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN</h4>How many times after that did he mention the subject to you?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER</h4>He didn't mention the subject. "May I marry you" again; he didn't
      say that, but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away
      to <font xmlns="" color="green">San Francisco</font>. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
      remark, "Isn't that just like <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>?" and
      thought no more of it.<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Claire Chao</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Well, but along toward the last thirty days prior to
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font> death, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
      he not? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER:</h4> No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with him very
      much. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Didn't you observe in him some jealousy? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER:</h4> Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least jealous
      man I ever met. He takes life too much -- <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Did he ever say anything to you about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall
         Neilan</font> loved <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Did he ever bring any tales to you for which <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> was
      supposed to have been responsible! <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER:</h4>Not until recently.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> When was that?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4><font xmlns="" color="orange">Last Friday night</font>; whereupon we had a severe
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">quarrel</font>. I didn't believe him.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4><font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday night</font> after the killing?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> Yes.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Or before the killing?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER:</h4> No; after.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Did he ever say anything like that to you before the killing?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> and
      he had known it.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Did he ever comment on that relation between you and
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> No, he did not; I wouldn't have permitted him to; and I didn't comment on
      his.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> I will use the word <font xmlns="" color="purple">"quarrel,"</font> but that may be
      exaggerated; did you ever quarrel with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Neilan</font> over
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> Absolutely not; absolutely not. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> is the
      typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and tempera­ment. He does
      perfectly terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves him. They are always
      glad to see him again. As to harboring any deep-seated malice, I don't believe he
      is capable of it. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Could he have assumed at any time you and he, you and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall
         Neilan</font> -- I am speaking of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font> now
      -- Could he have assumed at any time that he might be or was engaged to you by
      reason of your relations wtth him? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER: </h4> Could <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font> have assumed that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Taylor</font> and I were engaged?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> No, no; that you and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font> were enqaged?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> No.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Did you ever give him the impression that he might some day be successful in his
      effort to marry you? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER: </h4> Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I think
      I have at times said, "Well, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, when are we going all
      around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I took him to
      say, "Now, when you are my wedded bride we will do" so-and­-so.
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> has done that time after time. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Might he not have taken you seriously?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> I don't think so.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> Do you know he did not?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER: </h4> No, I don't know that he did not.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Don't you know that he was really -- Don't you feel that he was really in love
      with you?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am not
      sure enough of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan's</font> nature. While I have known him a
      great many years, well, I will say I have known him several years, he is the type
      who flits back and forth, you know. - When you really think you know him he turns
      to something else, and I don't know, so I have never permitted myself to form any
      conclusions on his character; I don't know whether he has ever taken me seriously
      or not. I always treated him more or less in a joking manner.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> I understand the night of the murrder you were with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Neilan</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER: </h4> No, I was not. I was at home with my grandmother and sister.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> I mean after the murder, after you learned of the murder.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER: </h4> Yes, <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> The <font xmlns="" color="orange">next night</font>, was it?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> No, it was the <font xmlns="" color="orange">night after Thursday</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font>
      -- I mean <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> was found dead <font xmlns="" color="orange">Thhursday
         morning</font>, was he not?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Yes.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4><font xmlns="" color="orange">Thursday</font> was such a long day. <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday night</font> I saw
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Neilan</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN: </h4> Did he. communicate w1 th you or you with him? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> Why, he communicated with me; he tried to, but it was because of me he did that.
      On <font xmlns="" color="orange">Thuraday night</font> I was worried about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>;
      I was worried about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font> and called <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall's
         mother</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Bella Crotta</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">Doran</h4>This was after the murder?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Minter</h4>Yes, this was <font xmlns="" color="orange">Thursday night</font> after the murder. I said, "Please tell <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mickey</font> not to
      drive that <font xmlns="" color="purple">green car</font> so reckless; I am so afraid that he, too, will fall into
      trouble. And she thanked me and said, "I will tell him. That is just exactly what
      I have been thinking lately myself, and I want to see you soon, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>." With that I
      thought no more about it. In fact, I didn't even think <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> would
      call me. He had not called me in three weeks or more. 1 thought no more about it and
      I was surprised the next day to learn -- yes, <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font> -- that he had tried to get
      me at <font xmlns="" color="orange">five-thirty</font>. My <font xmlns="" color="blue">sister</font> was at our <font xmlns="" color="green">old home</font> where there is a <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font>. The
      <font xmlns="" color="green">present home</font> has no <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font>, and when he happened to call there she was
      there.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Doran</h4>At <font xmlns="" color="orange">five-thirty</font> of what day?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Minter</h4><font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font>; and he said he was very anxious to see me. She knew I had left and was
      driving with <font xmlns="" color="blue">George Scarborough</font>, and she said she didn't know what time I would be
      back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him <font xmlns="" color="orange">before ten o'clock</font>, but <font xmlns="" color="orange">after
         ten o'clock</font> he would be on location. He didn't say the <font xmlns="" color="green">Salt Lake Station</font>, but he
      was very anxious to get hold of me <font xmlns="" color="orange">before ten o'clock</font>. I came in <font xmlns="" color="orange">after ten</font> and
      they all told me l had better call <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>; he seemed very anxious to get hold of
      me. I didn't· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font>. I waited for him awhile and he didn't come, and finally <font xmlns="" color="blue">grand­mother</font> said,
       "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Dearie</font>, If I were you I would call him up or at least call <font xmlns="" color="blue">his mother</font> and find
      out where he is." I called the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font> and the <font xmlns="" color="blue">night watchman</font> immediately said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Neilan</font> is not here; is this <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Minter</font>?" I said, "Yes."<font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font> And he said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Neilan</font> is at the <font xmlns="" color="green">Salt Lake Station</font>."<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Scarborough</font> and l drove down there in my
      runabout. He was very hard at work and had been <font xmlns="" color="orange">all night</font>, it seemed he had
      been working <font xmlns="" color="orange">all night</font> tor <font xmlns="" color="orange">four nights past</font>. They were all just dead tired.
      Night and day they had been working. He finished about <font xmlns="" color="orange">two-thirty</font>, and then there
      were several in the party, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria Swanson</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Jack Pickford</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Frank Urson</font> --<font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mr Frank
         Urson</font> is now associated with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font> as director -- and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> and myself. We
      went to <font xmlns="" color="green">his mother's home</font> where he lives with his mother and we tried to make <font xmlns="" color="purple">eggs</font>
      and things. It was very amusing; we only had four <font xmlns="" color="purple">eggs</font>, and I tried to fry two of
      them and ruined the things, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
      much noise his mother, who was ill upstairs, told us we must behave ourselves.
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said, "There is only one thing to do; I have got to talk to you. We have
      had all of this foolishness, and I have got something very important to say to
      you, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>. Let's drive to the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font> where we can talk." We drove down to the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Hollywood studio</font> and we sat there in the <font xmlns="" color="green">office</font>, the <font xmlns="" color="purple">lights</font> burning and the
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">watchman</font> was there and the <font xmlns="" color="blue">property man</font> was not around. He was outside. We talked
      until dawn; it was <font xmlns="" color="orange">dawn</font> when we came out of the place. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Doran</h4>What were you talking about?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Minter</h4>About <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> and <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font><font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font> had tried to get for me.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Doran</h4>Who had tried to get for you?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Minter</h4><font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> had tried to get for me, which was the first inkling I knew of his
      knowledge of my <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font>, that I had written any to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>. He told me certain
      very, very ghastly things have since been proven absolutely true. He told
      them to me in my interest, but they made me very furious at the time, and we left
      more or less in a quarrel. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Doran</h4>Will you please tell us everything that he told you there?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">Minter</h4>Yes, indeed. He first said,<font xmlns="" color="blue">"Mary</font>, sit down. I have something very importnat to
      tell you." I sat down, and he said, "You know this murder of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> is going to be
      the greatest <font xmlns="" color="orange">nine-days</font> wonder" or "<font xmlns="" color="orange">nineteen-days</font> wonder that we have ever had,
      certainly that <font xmlns="" color="green">Los Angeles</font> ever had. You don't know what a terrible thing it is
      going to be." I said, "Yes, I do. It is awful!" He said,  "Now, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>, I tried to
      get your <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font>"-- <br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Maria Estevez</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> We left location, he worked down at the <font xmlns="" color="green">Salt Lake Station</font>, about <font xmlns="" color="orange">two-thirty to a
         quarter to three</font>, we left there and went to <font xmlns="" color="green">his house</font>. How long we were there I
      couldn't say; I didn't have a <font xmlns="" color="purple">watch</font>; I imagine we were there about an hour or
      maybe more, and then we went on down to the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font> and we stayed until <font xmlns="" color="orange">dawn</font>,
      whatever time that is. We then came on back to <font xmlns="" color="green">my house</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mother</font> was waiting for us
      and we got out and explained to her. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mother</font> knew he had had a verious talk and she
      felt sure <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marhsall</font> would try to come to our aid. My <font xmlns="" color="blue">mother</font> is very fond of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Neilan</font> and the whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his
      hours when hee needed sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at
      <font xmlns="" color="orange"> eight o'clock </font> that morning and he didn't even go to <font xmlns="" color="purple">bed</font> that night. He just sat up
      in his <font xmlns="" color="purple">clothes</font> and went out to work again at <font xmlns="" color="orange"> eight o'clock </font>. Anyway, he said, "I
      tried to get your <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> for you. You know they are a very important factor in
      the case, if they get hold of them." I was shocked to find that he knew of my
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font>. I said that I wrote some, and he said something about going to a
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">newspaper</font> or getting hold of some body in <font xmlns="" color="green">Pasadena</font> to get me the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font>. That
      part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so tired at the time I couldn't
      understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would have questioned him again
      about the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> just what he did. He told me I should have received them that
      day. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't received the
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> today." He said, "Well, I sent them to the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font>, and I believe the
      <font xmlns="" color="green"> studio</font>," the <font xmlns="" color="green">Realart Studio</font> where I had last worked. He said, "They are in Charley
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Eyton's</font> hands now." He either said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Charley Eyton</font> or <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Carbut</font>, but I can't state
      this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly hear him and I was
      desperately interested to hear what he said about the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letter</font>, and I strained all
      my nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know
      the exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in
      the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> that the world can't read except that it is horribly painful to me to
      have them read my <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> to him." He said, "You loved <font xmlns="" color="blue">Billie</font>, didn't you?" I
      said, "Yes, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said, "Did you
      ever want to marry him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it couldn't
      have been. It was not meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then he said,
      "Now, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>, I am going to tell you some very important thing; they are going to
      hurt you, going to shock you, but before I say a word I want you to consider
      <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Billie</font> was just as crazy as a March hare months before his death." He said, "I am
      going to recite a few instances that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> told me about, things irrelevant to you,
      to show he didn't do this only to you but to others of his very best friends." Marshall and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> were extremely good friends. I don't think they saw each
      other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each other. He said, "On
      several occasions <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font>" -- he spoke of him as '<font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font>' -- "has confessed to me that
      -- Oh, I am so tired I can't think how I am trying­ to say it. He came up to my
      room in the <font xmlns="" color="green">club</font> one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about you, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>,
      and those gold-tipped <font xmlns="" color="purple">cigarettes</font> I found of yours." Whereupon <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said he
      replied, "Well, you needn't say anything, Bill" -- l don't know what it was, a
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">cigar</font> or something of some personal nature that he recognized of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>'s at
      <font xmlns="" color="green">somebody's house</font>. I don't know whose house. He said, "That makes us Elks. Don't
      you say anything about me, what I have been doing in a joking, friendly manner."
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>, he said, suddenly stood up and looked at him very seriously, soberly,
      and said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, I am surprised at the things you are doing now-a-days."
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said, "Just what do you mean by that?" and he said, "Why, what you said
      to your <font xmlns="" color="blue">wife</font> the other night at <font xmlns="" color="orange">Sunset</font> Inn about poor little <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria Swanson</font>."<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Anna Fazio</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns=""> Minter </h4>I may be getting some of those words mixed; maybe he didn't say "poor little
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria Swanson</font>." Maybe <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> didn't tell me that. This is my impression.
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Don't you remember the night we
      were at <font xmlns="" color="green">Sunset Inn</font> and you were sitting here and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Swanson</font> was sitting there
      and your former wife, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gertrude Banbrick</font>, came in and said, 'Hello, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria</font>, how are
      you?' and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria</font> replied pleasantly, and you turned to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gertrude Bambrick</font> and said,
      'How dare you speak to this girl?' pointing to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria</font>, the lady he was with, 'How
      dare you speak to her? Don't you ever dare to speak to her again,'" And <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>
      was telling <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said he looked at him and said, "What's the
      matter with you, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font>? Are you drunk?" He said, I haven't had a drink," <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>
      said, and he said, "The funny part of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect
      it on his breath. "But he looked quite as serious and sober as I do this minute."
      He said, "Why, tell me what day you think this was." He said it was on a certain
      day -- I don't know if <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> told me the day or not. He said, on a certain day
      at <font xmlns="" color="green">Sunset Inn</font> recently. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said, "Why, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font>, at that time l I was in <font xmlns="" color="green">New
         York City</font> and was not in <font xmlns="" color="green">Los Angeles</font> nor <font xmlns="" color="green">California</font>." <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> and he had quite a
      friendly argument over it, and he said, "I know it is so; I was there myself and
      heard what you said upon this greeting between those two girls." <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said he
      thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called up, haVing that in
      mind, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Swanson</font> and he said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Gloria</font>, am I going crazy? Have I lost my mind? Do
      you remember of ever being at Sunset Inn with me when Gertrude Bambrick passed our
      table and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my former wife for having spoken to
      you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she said, "What on
      earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you," And he said,
      "Do you ever remember seeing <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill Taylor</font> there near us at any time on any such
      occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy time I ever saw <font xmlns="" color="blue">William Taylor</font>
      at <font xmlns="" color="green">Sunset Inn</font> was the night I was with" -- I don't know his name, some friend of
      hers -- "and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill Taylor</font> was sitting away over on the other side by the wall and
      we were by the orchestra on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No.
      Don't you remember you were in <font xmlns="" color="green">New York</font> at the time?" He said, "That is one
      instance, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>, of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill's</font> failing mind, I have never cleared that up. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> and I
      have discussed it many times since, and I have always gone away puzzled, amazed,
      that he still stuck to his version of my having spoken to my former wife as I did.
      I didn't see her; neither <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Swanson</font> saw her on that occasion." Then he said,
      "On another occasion <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> told me he had received a <font xmlns="" color="purple">letter</font> from <font xmlns="" color="blue">Blanche Sweet</font>;
      that she told <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> that she was grieved he was sick;" that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshell Neilan</font>
      was calling on me and she intended to sue him. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said that sounded so
      unlike <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Sweet</font> that he went to her and questioned her, and he said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Blanche</font>,
      have you writtn to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> lately?" She said, "Why, yes, I wrote him a little <font xmlns="" color="purple">note</font>
      not so long ago thanking him for some poinsettias he sent me <font xmlns="" color="orange">Christmas</font>." He aa1d,
      "Did you say anything else?" She said, "No, not that I can remember." He said,
      "Did you ever say that you regretted my going about with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Minter</font> and that you
      intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly ridiculous. What do you mean? I
      certainly did not say any such thing."
      <br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">John Gehrig</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>MINTER: <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> at that time said to me, "And you know <font xmlns="" color="blue">Blanche</font> doesn't lie. She
      certainly doesn't lie; tbat is her reputation all over the world, over the <font xmlns="" color="purple">picture</font>
      game. I have heard that hundreds of times myself; I am pretty sure it is so." He
      said, "Now, that is another instance of poor <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill's</font> insanity. Now, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>, here is
      the ghastly thing I have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether
      he said in his <font xmlns="" color="green">room</font> or the <font xmlns="" color="green">club</font>, he was somewhere, I think in one of his own
      rooms, he, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Nieilan</font>, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Arthur Hoyt</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Cap Robinson</font> -- He said <font xmlns="" color="blue">"Cap
         Robinson</font>"; maybe he meant "Captain"; I don't know; I don't know how he is; I know
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Arthur</font> well. He said, "We were all standing around there talking pleasantly" -- I
      think he said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Antonio Moreno</font> was there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly
      and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> suddenly started talking about you, and the talk grew finally more
      and more personal and finally he said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he
      said you had been over in the <font xmlns="" color="orange">last two weeks</font>" -- I should say this is within at
      least <font xmlns="" color="orange">three weeks</font> of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor's</font> death; I think Marshall told me at the time, but
      I have forgotten the time. -- "within the last <font xmlns="" color="orange">two weeks</font>, that you were undressed
      in his <font xmlns="" color="green">apartments</font>; that you beseeched him for his love; that he resisted you, and
      finally persuaded you to leave his <font xmlns="" color="green">apartment</font>s." Marshall said that to me, and looked right at me. I could feel myself grow red.
      I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" He said, "Well, I could
      recite some more instances about Bill's seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain
      he was insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you
      now." <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MR MOTT:</h4>Excuse me. Did he refer to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor's</font> physical condition?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes, he said he was drunk at the time. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> has told <font xmlns="" color="blue">ma</font> on several occasions,
      sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> drink
      because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and
      silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly,
      foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to see him drink." At this
      time he was intoxicated and he talked on and on and on about this thing." <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>
      said he got up and he told <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font>, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with
      your mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were
      crazy," and that was tbe opinion of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Arthur Hoyt</font> and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Cap Robinson</font> and <font xmlns="" color="blue">everybody</font>.
      They were perfectly amazed that a man of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor's</font> lovable, sweet, considerate,
      gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this
      about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected.
      When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> and said, "Is that all you
      have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
      ghastly <font xmlns="" color="purple">thing</font>. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
      hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the murder of this man."
       By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted
      with shock, one shock after another and of all the <font xmlns="" color="purple">shocks</font> I had received, this
      coming from hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not
      as I knew <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>, I couldn't believe for an instant he had ever said these
      things to anybody, yet there <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> giving me names, dates and places. The thing
      was too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you
      are lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?"
      He got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was
      just furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well, Mary, some day you will
      realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me
      as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it
      is the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. <br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Tess Greenspan</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious
      with him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things
      about, "You know Mary that I care for you." <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> He told you he loved you, did he? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> Yes; he did on <font xmlns="" color="orange"> Friday night.</font>  He said,  "You know I care for you deeply."  I said,
      "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want John Jones to care
      for me or anybody; I don't want ever to be in love again as long as I live; I
      don't want to see any man; I hate men."   I probably raved on. I dont know what more
      I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting up all night. This
      conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It came with long
      pauses; he would get up and walk around with his <font xmlns="" color="purple">cigarette</font> smoking and come back
      again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of <font xmlns="" color="green">the office</font>, and I would
      sit there alone and I tore a <font xmlns="" color="purple">piece of paper</font>, I was so tired, and suggested that we
      go<font xmlns="" color="green"> home</font>. I said,  "Why keep sitting up? You have got to get up at <font xmlns="" color="orange"> eight o'clock in
         the morning </font>  and it is nearly dawn."  He aaid,  "I am worried about this thing; I
      want to find out what you know about this murder."  Then it developed that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>
      thought I knew something about it, and he looked at me and he said,  "Now,<font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mary"</font> --
      he got a little profane, he said,  "Now, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary,</font> for God's sake, if you know anything
      about the murder of <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Bill </font> tell it to me now."  He said,  "Don't withhold anything."  
      This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things about <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mr Taylor,</font>
      but there he sat evidently believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think
      that I killed <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor? </font> " He said,  "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk
      things like that. " He said,  "I am just trying to find something out about this.
      This is going to be an awful affair."  I said,  "I didn't kill <font xmlns="" color="blue"> William Desmond
         Taylor </font> and I don't know who murdered him." He said,  "You don't? You don't know
      anything?"   He said,  "Of course, you didn't kill him; of course, you didn't put
      anybody on to do it, But"  he said,  "don't you know somebody, don't you know some
      inti­mate details that other people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and
      think who would have a motive for killing him?"  Then he sat there and we said
      words about pro and con, trying to think, and I thought over everyrody I knew and
      I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I said,  "The only person I know who
      could have had a possible motive for killing him would be <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mrs. Julia Crawford 
         Ivers."</font> I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less humorous. She is a
      lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a wrong thing in her
      life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a Christian
      Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for many years;
      she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable respectable
      woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't like each
      other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she had a
      strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is <font xmlns="" color="blue">little Mary.</font> Here she
      comes." She would go on in this manner,  "Oh, there is <font xmlns="" color="blue">little Mary</font> again, Oh, there
      she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh."  Quite a strange
      attitude, She just riled me. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> How old a woman was she? <br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Devin Halliburton</font></h3>Questions by <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Doran</font>:<br xmlns=""></br>MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor's</font>
      camera man. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Jimmy</font> was my camera man,
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Jim Vantrees</font>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me.
      She is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of
      fate it was when I was in <font xmlns="" color="green">France</font> after looking at the
      beautifUl Venus de Muile in <font xmlns="" color="green">Paris</font> at the Louvre, and after
      I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who
      should I see but <font xmlns="" color="blue">Julia Crawford Ivers</font>, a very, fat, large
      woman. She did some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very
      unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Taylor</font>, she would always come and twit my chin. So I said, in really
      a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't think she had
      anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who would
      kill him but <font xmlns="" color="blue">Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</font>.""I always suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she
      might have killed him for that reason." He said, "My goodness!
      You mustn't say that out loud; somebody will believe you." I said,
      "I don't care if they do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, --
      What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked about his
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">productions</font> and said, "I certainly have a
      terrible time, working <font xmlns="" color="orange">day</font> and <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font> and a great deal
      depended upon <font xmlns="" color="orange">Saturday</font> and we must get certain work finished <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font>." We
      talked of <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font> and that he had to get up at <font xmlns="" color="orange">eight o'clock</font>; he
      wasn't going to <font xmlns="" color="purple">bed</font> at all; that the boys were calling
      for him at <font xmlns="" color="orange">eight o'clock</font>, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he
      would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
      <font xmlns="" color="green">location</font>, I understood, possibly at the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font>. He was just going <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>
      and take a <font xmlns="" color="green">shower</font>, get a shave if he felt like it, and go
      on back and work some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so
      exhausted, just dead." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this
      looks awful, being here all this time?" And he said, "I can't
      help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what
      you knew about this case. That I know you knew <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bill</font> very
      well, probably better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me
      to tel1 him my feelings toward <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>, exactly what
      everybody has been asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved
      him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I loved him truly, loved him in an
      all-around way, I cared for his health; his health came before my happiness and
      when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when he was ill-- my natural
      impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up night after night with him, if
      necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because he didn't want me to,
      and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and worrying about it, I
      did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want me.<br xmlns=""></br>DORAN: What time of <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font> did you first meet -- What is this man's
      name?<br xmlns=""></br>MINTER: <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font>?<br xmlns=""></br>DORAN: <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font>, this particular <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>.<br xmlns=""></br>MINTER: We went down to the <font xmlns="" color="green">Salt Lake station</font> after
      one.<br xmlns=""></br>DORAN: And you arrived at your <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>, was it, or his
      <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> or whose <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> was it where
      you were frying the <font xmlns="" color="purple">eggs</font>?<br xmlns=""></br>MINTER: His <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>, <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>; it was really <font xmlns="" color="orange">Saturday</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">morning</font>, wasn't it? I call lt <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>, because it was still <font xmlns="" color="orange">nighttime</font>. The five of us
      arrived there, oh, I don't know, he didn't finish work until between
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">two-thirty</font> and <font xmlns="" color="orange">three o'c1ock</font>, maybe after <font xmlns="" color="orange">three</font>; I
      didn't have a watch at that <font xmlns="" color="orange">time</font>.<br xmlns=""></br>DORAN: How long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font>?<br xmlns=""></br>MINTER: Now, let me see, we stayed at <font xmlns="" color="green"><font color="blue">Marshall</font>'s house</font>
      with the <font xmlns="" color="purple">eggs</font> and things at least an <font xmlns="" color="orange">hour</font>,
      maybe <font xmlns="" color="orange">two hours</font>; I am not certain of that at all; I don't think much
      more than an <font xmlns="" color="orange">hour</font>. Then we went right on to the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Nathan Herrold</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Do you suppose you spent <font xmlns="" color="orange">a couple of hours</font> down there?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> I think maybe we spent <font xmlns="" color="orange">a couple of hours</font>; maybe <font xmlns="" color="orange">three hours</font>; it takes a good
      while to go from <font xmlns="" color="green">Salt Lake station</font> up to
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Marshall's home on Sunset Boulevard</font>. It would take <font xmlns="" color="orange">at
         least forty-five minutes</font>, I think. Then it takes some time to go from
      <font xmlns="" color="green">his home</font> to <font xmlns="" color="green">the studio</font>, way out
      <font xmlns="" color="green">on Santa Monica Boulevard</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4> Where was <font xmlns="" color="green">the studio</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4> On <font xmlns="" color="green">Santa Monica Boulevard, the Hollyood Studios</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did you suggest that you go down there with him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>He said, "Let's go on down" -- No, the first thing he said was
      "Let's get out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold
      when we came in the house and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
      don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off <font xmlns="" color="purple">my coat</font>. He said,
      "If you are going to stay there and burn, let's go out and
      talk." We got in <font xmlns="" color="purple">the car</font> and drove around for a while. No, it is not a
      fact that he said in <font xmlns="" color="green">the house</font>, "We must go to <font xmlns="" color="green">the studio</font> and
      talk." I think I said that at first; it is not so. He said,
      "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very bitterly cold outside,
      freez1ng ocld.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>You left the rest of the party at <font xmlns="" color="green">the house</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No; <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Swanson</font> and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Pickford</font> got in
      Mr Pickford's <font xmlns="" color="purple">Locomobile</font> and he said he was going to take her home. She was very
      anxious to get to bed as she had to get up early and work.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Then, you and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font> drove around awhile and
      finally wound up in <font xmlns="" color="green">the studio</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes; we drove around, went out <font xmlns="" color="green">Sunset Boulevard</font> and went up -- We went along
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Hollywood Boulevard</font> for a while, <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>What did you discuss while you were riding around in <font xmlns="" color="purple">the machine</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Why, about this thing about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> and then also I was rather peeved at
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly
      the word. That sounds more as if I am interested in <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, and I am; I like
      him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, it was not
      a very nice thing the way you ran off the last time. I understood they were going
      out to dinner and you were coming to <font xmlns="" color="green">my house</font> to dinner and suddenly you went to
      <font xmlns="" color="green">San Francisco</font> without so much as a fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those
      things." I said, "Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your
      friends love you and love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do,
      darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no mood to take this foolishness; I
      want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know when you are going to appear."
      Many times a whole dinner has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a dinner
      party at <font xmlns="" color="green">our house</font>, or other people have given parties, they have waited on
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> for <font xmlns="" color="orange">two or three hours</font> and he finally would come along smiling sweetly at
      everybody and they couldn't scold him. I was more or less taking him to task for
      his 1ife in general, saying he should not do those things; it was very annoying
      and I was not going to put up with it. He was sweet and Irish and said, "You
      wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I wouldn't be." That is the way we
      got out of that. There was nothing serious in the talk, Just the way we always
      talked. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Then you finally went to <font xmlns="" color="green">the studio</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you, something
      that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11 go in
      <font xmlns="" color="green">the studio</font> and talk." Our teeth were chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and
      he turned on the steam and I sat in this <font xmlns="" color="purple">fur coat</font> in a <font xmlns="" color="purple">wicker chair</font>, and he said,
      "This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me
      all the things I have been telling you. There may have been some more, and some
      thlngs I have said may not be exactly accurate, but the gist of the thing is
      entirely accurate. <br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Eric Holsinger</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did he declare his love for you, whi1e rid1ng around in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">machine</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No, he did not.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Not until you reached the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font> did he do tha that?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Not until after we had been there a long time at the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> --<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was as
      sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>This was the second time that he had declared love for you. On one occasion he
      proposed to you?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>He asked you to marry him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes, and then he would dart away again. I mean he would call me up -- He can't call
      me up, because I have no <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font>; he would send me <font xmlns="" color="purple">flowers</font>, too, and suddenly I
      would not hear from him for two or <font xmlns="" color="orange">three weeks</font>. As I said to him in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>, not
      particularly about that but about other things, about dinner engagements, about &amp;
      appointments, I said, "You know, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, I never know when l
      am going to see you and when I am not going to see you, and just what you are going
      to do, and I am in no mood to go on like that at all; I don't care much about
      it."<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>When did you tell him that?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>I told him that when we were driving the <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>How old a man is <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Just thirty.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Has he ever been married?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes, he has been married once for a <font xmlns="" color="orange">few days</font>. He remained married to his wife for a
      long time, for <font xmlns="" color="orange">seven years</font>, I think, but he was actually only married a <font xmlns="" color="orange">few days</font>. I
      think he married when he was twenty or nineteen.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Have you seen him since this <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday night</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No, I have not.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Have you talked with him over the <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>It was really <font xmlns="" color="orange">Saturday morning</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Has he called you up on the <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No; he may have called me at the <font xmlns="" color="green">New Hampshire house</font> and I wouldn't know.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>You haven't talked with him over the <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>I haven't seen him or talked to him or come in touch with him in any way<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>You haven't received any <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> from him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did you part friendly or unfriendly?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>We did part more or less friendly, as I always did with
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>, no matter how angry I would become with him,
      somehow you can't bear malice against that boy.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>You have become angry with him on other occasions?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...] <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Neilan</font> -- <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font>, and at the time of
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor's</font> death, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry</font> was the
      assistant director in <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor's</font> companies there, and he had
      said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry</font> had been in the <font xmlns="" color="green">room</font> looking over the effects -- Just
      a minute. I wonder if <font xmlns="" color="blue">Charles Maigne</font> told me this. I think
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font> told me this, too, that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry</font>
      bad gotten the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> and taken them to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Jim Vantrees</font>, the
      <font xmlns="" color="purple">camera</font> man, whereupon I remarked, "I will bet <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs Ivers</font>
      had them," and I think he said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Jim</font> gave them
      to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Eyton</font>," and that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Eyton</font>
      turned some of them over to the Examiner. I am so afraid l am telling things that
      are
      not so here, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Doran</font>; I don't mean to, but I couldn't get all
      of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do remember this part, he said
      he
      heard about them, and I don't know how he heard about them, and that he went down,
      I
      believe, to the Examiner, to get ahold of them and he had something to do with
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Pasadena</font>, a man, he did tell me the man's name. I don't remember his name, but I
      believe it be­gan with "S", and this man, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said he was
      the big man over the entire Examiner force, told him to go down and take the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font>.
      He said, "Of course, if you breathe this it wi11 just about throw me in <font xmlns="" color="green">jail</font>
      for the rest of my life," but I don't believe it will. Then he said,
      "Didn't you get them today?" I said, "I did not." As
      well as I remember, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> said, "I then sent them to
      the <font xmlns="" color="green">Realart Studio</font> and they ought to be in <font xmlns="" color="blue">Charley's</font> hands
      now or Mr Garbut." This whole <font xmlns="" color="orange">Friday night</font> is most hasy in my
      recollection.<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Evan Klimas</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>This man knew before you were in love with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Oh, yes.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>You had told him that, had you not?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No; in fact, I had never said to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>"I am in love with <font xmlns="" color="blue">William Desmond
         Taylor</font>." I never had.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>How did he find it out, then?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>He knew about it, because we had been friends a long time. Before
      this <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font> had come to my
      <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font> very despondent and said, "I think I will
      go out in the <font xmlns="" color="green">garden</font> and eat <font xmlns="" color="purple">wooly
         worms</font>."
      I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel the same
      way." I am certain he knew about this thing. I made no secret of it,
      but I didn't promenade it about.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Don't you have a recollection of having told him, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>, that you were fond of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No. Many times I said, "I admire <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>; I respect him; you know I respect his opinion; what a
      wonderful man I consider him to be." He knew I regarded him most
      highly.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Do you remember if he asked you at the time he pro­posed to you
      if you were in love with any one else?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">INTER:</h4>No, he didn't ask me that at all.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of
      him?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>There was only one possible admirer, and that was <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Dickson</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Any besides <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Dickson</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No; in fact, if I may say so, neither <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Dickson</font> nor <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font> has been
      with me constantly enough, or I feel really care enough for me to do any such
      thing in my behalf, I mean such as commit murder. In my own mind I am absolutely
      convinced that I know they would not.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Yon think they are incapable, in other words?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>I absolutely do.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>What kind of <font xmlns="" color="purple">cigarettes</font> was <font xmlns="" color="blue">Neilan</font> smoking the night at the studio?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>He smokes two kinds of <font xmlns="" color="purple">cigarettes</font>. He smokes a gold tipped called "Dimi" something from
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Egypt</font>, I forget the name, "D" something; I noticed it
      comes from <font xmlns="" color="green">Cairo</font>; then he smokes <font xmlns="" color="purple">Chesterfield
         cigarettes</font>. At least, I have seen him smoking
      <font xmlns="" color="pink">Chesterfield cigarettes</font>. I remember that much, because I
      have always admired the face of the Chesterfield boy on that <font xmlns="" color="purple">red back
         sign</font>, you know, that laughing boy in the light hair that says,
      "Gee"! They satisfy!"<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did <font xmlns="" color="blue">Neilan</font> take you
      <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> then that morning from the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font> or did you go back in your own <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No; my <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font> had been driven back to its
      <font xmlns="" color="green">garage</font> by <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Neilan</font>'s
      chauffeur with my friend <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Scarborough</font> in it. Poor <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr
         Scarborough</font> had been driving around with me all evening. I hadn't
      been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out. He said if I didn't mind he would
      just go on back <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>, now that I was in safe hands, and get
      some sleep. He was pretty near dead tired. He isn't a very strong man.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>So <font xmlns="" color="blue">Neilan</font> took you
      <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> then<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes; right straight <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did he ask you to keep in confidence the conversation you had
      had with him? Did he tell you not to say anything about it?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>l don't remember him saying to me, "You must keep this all
      in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I do not, because when we got
      <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> we discussed some of the things with mother, with
      the whole family, in fact; he discussed the seriousness of the conversation and
      told me not to do anything without my at­torneys.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>He told you that?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>Yes; he said, "You mustn't make any move without your
      attorneys." He spoke of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Mott</font> and
      said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Mott</font> was very able and that he would tell
      me the right thing to do and not to make a move without him.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did you comment on his concern?<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">MINTER:</h4>No.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns="">DORAN:</h4>Did you say anything to him, for instance to this effect:
      "Why should you be so concerned about me? Why should I consult
      attorneys in connection with this affair?" or
      anything like that?<br xmlns=""></br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Audrey Lee</font></h3>
      <h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked him if he suspected me of
      killing <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>, we had that out; he assured me he didn't suspect any such
      thing, but he was very much impressed with the gravity of the situation. In fact,
      evidently he knew at that time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I
      mean that they would drag everybody's name into it; that the papers could get hold
      of for the notoriety of it. He said, "This involves picture people and you know
      how <font xmlns="" color="blue">Hearst</font> hates the picture people. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Hearst</font> would do anything &amp; could if he
      thought you did know <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font>," "There are lots of prominent people in the
      profession who knew him and loved him. They are certainly going to drag your name
      into it." <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> You didn't telephone <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> on the <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font> he was murdered? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> No. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> Where did you happen to be that <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> I was at <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> reading the <font xmlns="" color="purple">Cruise of the Kewa</font>. It is a humorous <font xmlns="" color="purple">book</font>; it is
      really a travesty of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Frederick O'Brien's</font> stories of the South Seas. It is very
      funny, and I laid there laughing all the <font xmlns="" color="orange">evening</font>. I was very -- right while I was
      laying on the <font xmlns="" color="purple">couch</font> reading aloud to <font xmlns="" color="blue">mother</font> and sister and we were all laughing
      heartily at that time, and at the same time <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor</font> was being murdered. It seems
      very horrible to me. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4>You had no company at home that <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Stockdale</font>, he generally did, or
      maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just remember. Usually every evening somebody
      drops [page 40] in. I know they were not there at the time I was reading the book.
      <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> Your <font xmlns="" color="purple">automobiles</font> were all home? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> Yes, unless I put my <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font> in the garage called the <font xmlns="" color="green">Standard Garage</font>. I leave it
      there sometimes, the <font xmlns="" color="green">Standard Garage</font> on <font xmlns="" color="green">Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue</font>.
      Sometimes when my girl friends stop with me and have her <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>, I would move out and
      put it in this garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for several days. I haven't
      been feeling well for some time; I have had bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when
      this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used the little car very much.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> Do you have a chauffeur? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> Yes; faithful old <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncy</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncy</font> is just as concerned about this thing as my
      mother is.<br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> Mr Doran, if I can be of any possible help in any way, it is true I don't know
      any more than I have told you; if I can, please call on me the first thing, won't
      you? <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> DORAN: </h4> Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
      appreciate the imporance, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Mott</font>. <br xmlns=""></br><h4 xmlns=""> MINTER: </h4> As I told <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Mott</font> today, I remember saying to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Mott</font>, "I am so tired I am like
      a little child. I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress,
      and I don't see exactly what I am doing." <br xmlns=""></br><hr />
